# ARLQ, another rogue-like quest game

ARLQ (Another Rogue-Like Quest) is an experimental rogue-like game created through a collaboration between humans and ChatGPT, who worked together on both the code and the manual.

* The code was generated by ChatGPT based on a rough description of the game, and humans then adjusted and improved the details.
  * ChatGPT also handled tasks beyond code generation, such as creating the maze generation algorithm and explaining how to use the curses library.
  * Type hints and comments were generated by ChatGPT.
  * ChatGPT even helped come up with ideas for new monsters.
* The manual was drafted by humans and later edited and proofread with ChatGPT.

## Installation Instructions

Run the following command to install:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/tos-kamiya/arlq
```

Once installed, the `arlq` command becomes available.

- Without any options, the game will run in a Pygame window.  
- To make the game easier, use the `-T` option (expands the visible area).  
- To make the game more difficult, use the `-F` option (enlarges the field) or the `-t` option (reduces the visible area).  
- With the `--curses` option, the game will run in the terminal using curses.  

To use the `--curses` option, you need to install the `curses` package separately:

For Ubuntu 24.04:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-curses
```

For Windows:

```bash
pip install windows-curses
```

## Game Description

* **Objective**  
  The goal of the game is to explore a dungeon with different corridors each time and find the treasure chest hidden by the dragon.

* **Player**  
  The player controls the character represented by “@” using the arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right.

* **Monsters**  
  The dungeon is filled with various monsters.  
  For example:  
  - `a`: Weak enough to be defeated from the start. Useful for leveling up.  
  - `b`: The second weakest. Defeating it provides plenty of food. Hunt it when you're hungry.  
  
  Initially, monsters appear as “?” or "!"; when you come into contact with them, their type (such as `a`, `b`, `c`, etc.) is revealed.

* **Fog System**  
  The game uses a fog system where only the areas the player has walked on are visible. In combination with auto-mapping, once an area is visited, it remains visible.

* **Combat**  
  Combat begins when the player touches a monster.  
  - If the monster is at or below the player’s level, you can defeat it, level up, and obtain any items the monster was carrying.  
  - However, if you lose to a monster that is a higher level than you, you will respawn at a random location within the dungeon.  
  Monsters generally do not move; they wait for the player to approach. It is up to the player to decide whether to fight or bypass them.

* **Rare Types**  
  Some monsters have a rare type with special features that differ from the normal ones.  
  For example:  
  - `A` (Amoeba Rare): A rare amoeba that significantly boosts your level upon defeat.  
  - `B` (Bison Rare): Tastier than a normal bison. Provides even more food.  

* **Food System**  
  Every time the player moves, their food supply decreases.  
  If your food reaches zero, you lose the game from hunger. Therefore, you need to replenish your food frequently. Defeating the Bison (`b`) provides plenty of food.

* **Game End**  
  The game is cleared when you touch the treasure chest (represented by `T`). Your goal is to obtain the treasure chest guarded by the dragon.
